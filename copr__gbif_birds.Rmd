library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(lubridate)
```

### Objective: 5 observations for all taxa with at least one observation from selected observers 

```{r}
#read in data, clean 
gbif_birds_obs <- read_csv(here("GBIF_bird_obs_clipped.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% #column names
  mutate(gbif_birds_obs,date = paste(year, month, day, sep = "-")) #create new date column  
```

```{r}
gbif_birds_obs_filtered <- gbif_birds_obs %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% #group by species,
  filter(recorded_by %in% c("Mark Holmgren", "Dave Comption", "Nick Lethaby", "Tom Turner", "Jasen Liu") | (year >= 1968)) %>% #filter for selected observers OR date (to include records without selected observers)
  top_n(5, date) #select top 5 records for each species by date (most recent)
```
